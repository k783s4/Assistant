                                                This program is a WIP
SpeechR takes voice commands and excecutes them.

Already added commands:
  * press X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#simulates a keypress, you can input single keys, phrases or combinations of keys(WIP)
  * search foo.com/bar _or_ search foo&nbsp;#inputs a URL or Google search into Firefox
  * and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#append commands (press x and search foo)
 
Yet to come:
  * how much does x cost?                #search for prices online
  * Maths                                #calculate stuff
  * continued conversation               #answer questions based on previous answer (how much does x cost? _$1_ how much is that in euros? _â‚¬0.86_)
  * launch applications                  #start any program
  * play music
  * ...and much more
